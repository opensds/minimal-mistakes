Wrapping up right on time, the team completed the Bali development cycle last
week. This release brings a lot of great new functionality. Really an
impressive accomplishment by all involved.

The Capri release will get underway shortly, but it's a perfect time of the
year to take a break and look back at all that was done over the last year.
Truly impressive!

### On to Capri

We are working on finalizing the Capri development cycle schedule now. Expect
that to show up on [releases.opensds.io](https://releases.opensds.io/) very
soon!

We have a lot of really good plans for Capri shaping up and are excited to see
where things go from here.

A huge thank you to everyone that has been involved in the development,
support, and feedback that has helped shape OpenSDS so far!
